Presley
birthplace
in
Tupelo
Mississippi
Elvis
Presley
was
born
on
January
in
Tupelo
Mississippi
to
Gladys
Love
Presley
Smith
in
the
two
room
shotgun
house
built
by
his
father
Vernon
Elvis
Presley
in
preparation
for
the
birth
Jesse
Garon
Presley
his
identical
twin
brother
was
delivered
minutes
before
him
stillborn
Presley
became
close
to
both
parents
and
formed
an
especially
close
bond
with
his
mother
The
family
attended
an
Assembly
of
God
church
where
he
found
his
initial
musical
inspiration
Presley
ancestry
was
primarily
Western
European
mix
On
his
mother
side
he
was
Scots
Irish
with
some
French
Norman
Gladys
and
the
rest
of
the
family
apparently
believed
that
her
great
great
grandmother
Morning
Dove
White
was
Cherokee
the
biography
by
Elaine
Dundy
supports
the
idea
but
at
least
one
genealogy
researcher
has
contested
it
on
multiple
grounds
Vernon
forebears
were
of
German
or
Scottish
origin
Gladys
was
regarded
by
relatives
and
friends
as
the
dominant
member
of
the
small
family
Vernon
moved
from
one
odd
job
to
the
next
evincing
little
ambition
The
family
often
relied
on
help
from
neighbors
and
government
food
assistance
In
they
lost
their
home
after
Vernon
was
found
guilty
of
altering
check
written
by
his
landowner
and
sometime
employer
He
was
jailed
for
eight
months
and
Gladys
and
Elvis
moved
in
with
relatives
In
September
Presley
entered
first
grade
at
East
Tupelo
Consolidated
where
his
instructors
regarded
him
as
average
He
was
encouraged
to
enter
singing
contest
after
impressing
his
schoolteacher
with
rendition
of
Red
Foley
country
song
Old
Shep
during
morning
prayers
The
contest
held
at
the
Mississippi
Alabama
Fair
and
Dairy
Show
on
October
was
his
first
public
performance
Ten
year
old
Presley
was
dressed
as
cowboy
he
stood
on
chair
to
reach
the
microphone
and
sang
Old
Shep
He
recalled
placing
fifth
few
months
later
Presley
received
his
first
guitar
for
his
birthday
he
had
hoped
for
something
else
by
different
accounts
either
bicycle
or
rifle
Over
the
following
year
he
received
basic
guitar
lessons
from
two
of
his
uncles
and
the
new
pastor
at
the
family
church
Presley
recalled
took
the
guitar
and
watched
people
and
learned
to
play
little
bit
But
would
never
sing
in
public
was
very
shy
about
it
In
September
Presley
entered
new
school
Milam
for
sixth
grade
he
was
regarded
as
loner
The
following
year
he
began
bringing
his
guitar
to
school
on
daily
basis
He
played
and
sang
during
lunchtime
and
was
often
teased
as
trashy
kid
who
played
hillbilly
music
By
then
the
family
was
living
in
largely
African
American
neighborhood
Presley
was
devotee
of
Mississippi
Slim
show
on
the
Tupelo
radio
station
WELO
He
was
described
as
crazy
about
music
by
Slim
younger
brother
who
was
one
of
Presley
classmates
and
often
took
him
into
the
station
Slim
supplemented
Presley
guitar
tuition
by
demonstrating
chord
techniques
When
his
prot
was
years
old
Slim
scheduled
him
for
two
on
air
performances
Presley
was
overcome
by
stage
fright
the
first
time
but
succeeded
in
performing
the
following
week
Teenage
life
in
Memphis
In
November
the
family
moved
to
Memphis
Tennessee
After
residing
for
nearly
year
in
rooming
houses
they
were
granted
two
bedroom
apartment
in
the
public
housing
complex
known
as
the
Lauderdale
Courts
Enrolled
at
Humes
High
School
Presley
received
only
in
music
in
eighth
grade
When
his
music
teacher
told
him
he
had
no
aptitude
for
singing
he
brought
in
his
guitar
the
next
day
and
sang
recent
hit
Keep
Them
Cold
Icy
Fingers
Off
Me
in
an
effort
to
prove
otherwise
classmate
later
recalled
that
the
teacher
agreed
that
Elvis
was
right
when
he
said
that
she
didn
appreciate
his
kind
of
singing
He
was
usually
too
shy
to
perform
openly
and
was
occasionally
bullied
by
classmates
who
viewed
him
as
mama
boy
In
he
began
practicing
guitar
regularly
under
the
tutelage
of
Jesse
Lee
Denson
neighbor
two
and
half
years
his
senior
They
and
three
other
boys
including
two
future
rockabilly
pioneers
brothers
Dorsey
and
Johnny
Burnette
formed
loose
musical
collective
that
played
frequently
around
the
Courts
That
September
he
began
ushering
at
Loew
State
Theater
Other
jobs
followed
Precision
Tool
Loew
again
and
MARL
Metal
Products
During
his
junior
year
Presley
began
to
stand
out
more
among
his
classmates
largely
because
of
his
appearance
he
grew
out
his
sideburns
and
styled
his
hair
with
rose
oil
and
Vaseline
In
his
free
time
he
would
head
down
to
Beale
Street
the
heart
of
Memphis
thriving
blues
scene
and
gaze
longingly
at
the
wild
flashy
clothes
in
the
windows
of
Lansky
Brothers
By
his
senior
year
he
was
wearing
them
Overcoming
his
reticence
about
performing
outside
the
Lauderdale
Courts
he
competed
in
Humes
Annual
Minstrel
show
in
April
Singing
and
playing
guitar
he
opened
with
Till
Waltz
Again
with
You
recent
hit
for
Teresa
Brewer
Presley
recalled
that
the
performance
did
much
for
his
reputation
wasn
popular
in
school
failed
music
only
thing
ever
failed
And
then
they
entered
me
in
this
talent
show
when
came
onstage
heard
people
kind
of
rumbling
and
whispering
and
so
forth
cause
nobody
knew
even
sang
It
was
amazing
how
popular
became
after
that
Presley
who
received
no
formal
music
training
and
could
not
read
music
studied
and
played
by
ear
He
also
frequented
record
stores
that
provided
jukeboxes
and
listening
booths
to
customers
He
knew
all
of
Hank
Snow
songs
and
he
loved
records
by
other
country
singers
such
as
Roy
Acuff
Ernest
Tubb
Ted
Daffan
Jimmie
Rodgers
Jimmie
Davis
and
Bob
Wills
The
Southern
gospel
singer
Jake
Hess
one
of
his
favorite
performers
was
significant
influence
on
his
ballad
singing
style
He
was
regular
audience
member
at
the
monthly
All
Night
Singings
downtown
where
many
of
the
white
gospel
groups
that
performed
reflected
the
influence
of
African
American
spiritual
music
He
adored
the
music
of
black
gospel
singer
Sister
Rosetta
Tharpe
Like
some
of
his
peers
he
may
have
attended
blues
venues
of
necessity
in
the
segregated
South
only
on
nights
designated
for
exclusively
white
audiences
He
certainly
listened
to
the
regional
radio
stations
such
as
WDIA
AM
that
played
race
records
spirituals
blues
and
the
modern
backbeat
heavy
sound
of
rhythm
and
blues
Many
of
his
future
recordings
were
inspired
by
local
African
American
musicians
such
as
Arthur
Crudup
and
Rufus
Thomas
King
recalled
that
he
had
known
Presley
before
he
was
popular
when
they
both
used
to
frequent
Beale
Street
By
the
time
he
graduated
from
high
school
in
June
Presley
had
already
singled
out
music
as
his
future

In
August
Presley
walked
into
the
offices
of
Sun

He
aimed
to
pay
for
few
minutes
of
studio
time
to
record
two
sided
acetate
disc
My
Happiness
and
That
When
Your

He
would
later
claim
that
he
intended
the
record
as
gift
for
his
mother
or
that
he
was
merely
interested
in
what
he
sounded
like
although
there
was
much
cheaper
amateur
record
making
service
at
nearby
general
store
Biographer
Peter
Guralnick
argues
that
he
chose
Sun
in
the
hope
of
being
discovered
Asked
by
receptionist
Marion
Keisker
what
kind
of
singer
he
was
Presley
responded
sing
all
kinds
When
she
pressed
him
on
who
he
sounded
like
he
repeatedly
answered
don
sound
like
nobody
After
he
recorded
Sun
boss
Sam
Phillips
asked
Keisker
to
note
down
the
young
man

which
she
did

In

but
again
nothing
came
of
it
Not
long
after
he
failed
an
audition
for
local
vocal
quartet
the
Songfellows
He
explained
to
his
father
They
told
me
couldn
sing
Songfellow
Jim
Hamill
later
claimed
that
he
was
turned
down
because
he
did
not
demonstrate
an
ear
for
harmony
at
the
time
In
April
Presley
began
working
for
the
Crown
Electric
company
as
truck
driver
His
friend
Ronnie
Smith
after
playing
few
local
gigs
with
him
suggested
he
contact
Eddie
Bond
leader
of
Smith
professional
band
which
had
an
opening
for
vocalist
Bond
rejected
him
after
tryout
advising
Presley
to
stick
to
truck
driving
because
you
re
never
going
to
make
it
as
singer
Phillips
meanwhile
was
always
on
the
lookout
for
someone
who
could
bring
to
broader
audience
the
sound
of
the
black
musicians
on
whom
Sun
focused
As
Keisker
reported
Over
and
over
remember
Sam
saying
If
could
find
white
man
who
had
the
Negro
sound
and
the
Negro
feel
could
make
billion
dollars
In
June
he
acquired
demo
recording
by
Jimmy
Sweeney
of
ballad
Without
You
that
he
thought
might
suit
the
teenage
singer
Presley
came
by
the
studio
but
was
unable
to
do
it
justice
Despite
this
Phillips
asked
Presley
to
sing
as
many
numbers
as
he
knew
He
was
sufficiently
affected
by
what
he
heard
to
invite
two
local
musicians
guitarist
Winfield
Scotty
Moore
and
upright
bass
player
Bill
Black
to
work
something
up
with
Presley
for
recording
session
That
All
Right
MENU
Presley
transformed
not
only
the
sound
but
the
emotion
of
the
song
turning
what
had
been
written
as
lament
for
lost
love
into
satisfied
declaration
of
independence

The
session
held
the
evening
of
July
proved
entirely
unfruitful
until
late
in
the
night
As
they
were
about
to
give
up
and
go
home
Presley
took
his
guitar
and
launched
into
blues
number
Arthur
Crudup
That
All
Right
Moore
recalled
All
of
sudden
Elvis
just
started
singing
this
song
jumping
around
and
acting
the
fool
and
then
Bill
picked
up
his
bass
and
he
started
acting
the
fool
too
and
started
playing
with
them
Sam
think
had
the
door
to
the
control
booth
open
he
stuck
his
head
out
and
said
What
are
you
doing
And
we
said
We
don
know
Well
back
up
he
said
try
to
find
place
to
start
and
do
it
again
Phillips
quickly
began
taping
this
was
the
sound
he
had
been
looking
for
Three
days
later
popular
Memphis
DJ
Dewey
Phillips
played
That
All
Right
on
his
Red
Hot
and
Blue
show
Listeners
began
phoning
in
eager
to
find
out
who
the
singer
was
The
interest
was
such
that
Phillips
played
the
record
repeatedly
during
the
last
two
hours
of
his
show
Interviewing
Presley
on
air
Phillips
asked
him
what
high
school
he
attended
in
order
to
clarify
his
color
for
the
many
callers
who
had
assumed
he
was
black
During
the
next
few
days
the
trio
recorded
bluegrass
number
Bill
Monroe
Blue
Moon
of
Kentucky
again
in
distinctive
style
and
employing
jury
rigged

that
Sam
Phillips
dubbed

on

Early
live
performances
and
signing
with
RCA
The
trio
played
publicly
for
the
first
time
on
July
at
the
Bon
Air
club
Presley
still
sporting
his
child
size
guitar
At
the
end
of
the
month
they
appeared
at
the
Overton
Park
Shell
with
Slim
Whitman
headlining
combination
of
his
strong
response
to
rhythm
and
nervousness
at
playing
before
large
crowd
led
Presley
to
shake
his
legs
as
he
performed
his
wide
cut
pants
emphasized
his
movements
causing
young
women
in
the
audience
to
start
screaming
Moore
recalled
During
the
instrumental
parts
he
would
back
off
from
the
mike
and
be
playing
and
shaking
and
the
crowd
would
just
go
wild
Black
natural
showman
whooped
and
rode
his
bass
hitting
double
licks
that
Presley
would
later
remember
as
really
wild
sound
like
jungle
drum
or
something
Soon
after
Moore
and
Black
quit
their
old
band
the
Starlite
Wranglers
to
play
with
Presley
regularly
and
DJ
and
promoter
Bob
Neal
became
the
trio
manager
From
August
through
October
they
played
frequently
at
the
Eagle
Nest
club
and
returned
to
Sun
Studio
for
more
recording
sessions
and
Presley
quickly
grew
more
confident
on
stage
According
to
Moore
His
movement
was
natural
thing
but
he
was
also
very
conscious
of
what
got
reaction
He
do
something
one
time
and
then
he
would
expand
on
it
real
quick
Presley
made
what
would
be
his
only
appearance
on
Nashville
Grand
Ole
Opry
stage
on
October
after
polite
audience
response
Opry
manager
Jim
Denny
told
Phillips
that
his
singer
was
not
bad
but
did
not
suit
the
program
Louisiana

radio
commercial
and
first
television
performance
In
November
Presley
performed
on
Louisiana
Hayride
the
Opry
chief
and
more
adventurous
rival
The
Shreveport
based
show
was
broadcast
to
radio
stations
in
states
Presley
had
another
attack
of
nerves
during
the
first
set
which
drew
muted
reaction
more
composed
and
energetic
second
set
inspired
an
enthusiastic
response
House
drummer
Fontana
brought
new
element
complementing
Presley
movements
with
accented
beats
that
he
had
mastered
playing
in
strip
clubs
Soon
after
the
show
the
Hayride
engaged

worth
of
Saturday

Founded

on
November
for

Elvis
made
his
first
television
appearance
on
the
KSLA
TV
television
broadcast
of
Louisiana
Hayride
Soon
after
he
failed
an
audition
for
Arthur
Godfrey
Talent
Scouts
on
the
CBS
television
network
By
early
Presley
regular
Hayride
appearances
constant
touring
and
well
received
record
releases
had
made
him
regional
star
from
Tennessee
to
West
Texas
In
January
Neal
signed
formal
management
contract
with
Presley
and
brought
the
singer
to
the
attention
of
Colonel
Tom
Parker
whom
he
considered
the
best
promoter
in
the
music
business
Parker
who
claimed
to
be
from
West
Virginia
he
was
actually
Dutch
had
acquired
an
honorary
colonel
commission
from
country
singer
turned
Louisiana
governor
Jimmie
Davis
Having
successfully
managed
top

Arnold
Parker
was
now

tour
When
the
tour
reached
Odessa
Texas
year
old
Roy
Orbison
saw
Presley
for
the
first
time
His
energy
was
incredible
his
instinct
was
just
amazing
just
didn
know
what
to
make
of
it
There
was
just
no
reference
point
in
the
culture
to
compare
it
By
August
Sun
had
released
ten
sides
credited
to
Elvis
Presley
Scotty
and
Bill
on
the
latest
recordings
the
trio
were
joined
by
drummer
Some
of
the
songs
like
That
All
Right
were
in
what
one
Memphis
journalist
described
as
the
idiom
of
negro
field
jazz
others
like
Blue
Moon
of
Kentucky
were
more
in
the
country
field
but
there
was
curious
blending
of
the
two
different
musics
in
both
This
blend
of
styles
made
it
difficult
for
Presley
music
to
find
radio
airplay
According
to
Neal
many
country
music
disc
jockeys
would
not
play
it
because
he
sounded
too
much
like
black
artist
and
none
of
the
rhythm
and
blues
stations
would
touch
him
because
he
sounded
too
much
like
hillbilly
The
blend
came
to
be
known
as
rockabilly
At
the
time
Presley
was
variously
billed
as
The
King
of
Western
Bop
The
Hillbilly
Cat
and
The
Memphis
Flash
Presley
renewed
Neal
management
contract
in
August
simultaneously
appointing
Parker
as
his
special
adviser
The
group
maintained
an
extensive
touring
schedule
throughout
the
second
half
of
the
year
Neal
recalled
It
was
almost
frightening
the
reaction
that
came
to
Elvis
from
the
teenaged
boys
So
many
of
them
through
some
sort
of
jealousy
would
practically
hate
him
There
were
occasions
in
some
towns
in
Texas
when
we
have
to
be
sure
to
have
police
guard
because
somebody
always
try
to
take
crack
at
him
They
get
gang
and
try
to
waylay
him
or
something
The
trio
became
quartet
when
Hayride
drummer
Fontana
joined
as
full
member
In
mid
October
they
played
few
shows
in
support
of
Bill
Haley
whose
Rock
Around
the
Clock
had
been
number
one
hit
the
previous
year
Haley
observed
that
Presley
had
natural
feel
for
rhythm
and
advised
him
to
sing
fewer
ballads
At
the
Country
Disc
Jockey
Convention
in
early
November
Presley
was
voted
the
year
most
promising
male
artist
Several
record
companies
had
by
now
shown
interest
in
signing
him
After
three
major
labels
made
offers
of
up
to
Parker
and
Phillips
struck
deal
with
RCA
Victor
on
November
to
acquire
Presley
Sun
contract
for
an
unprecedented
Presley
at
was
still
minor
so
his
father
signed
the
contract
Parker
arranged
with
the
owners
of
Hill
and
Range
Publishing
Jean
and
Julian
Aberbach
to
create
two
entities
Elvis
Presley
Music
and
Gladys
Music
to
handle
all
the
new
material
recorded
by
Presley
Songwriters
were
obliged
to
forgo
one
third
of
their
customary
royalties
in
exchange
for
having
him
perform
their
compositions
By
December
RCA
had
begun
to
heavily
promote
its
new
singer
and
before
month
end
had
reissued

The

Parker
finally
brought

to
national

After
his

on

Presley
stayed

of
Presley

repertoire
for
some
time
covers
of
Little
Richard
Ray
Charles
and
The
Drifters
As
described
by
Hilburn
these
were
the
most
revealing
of
all
Unlike
many
white
artists
who
watered
down
the
gritty
edges
of
the
original
versions
of
songs
in
the
Presley
reshaped
them
He
not
only
injected
the
tunes
with
his
own
vocal
character
but
also
made
guitar
not
piano
the
lead
instrument
in
all
three
cases
It
became
the
first
rock

album
to
top
the
Billboard

not
an
innovative
guitarist
like
Moore
or
contemporary
African
American
rockers
Bo
Diddley
and
Chuck

cultural
historian
Gilbert
Rodman
argues
that
the
album
cover
image
of
Elvis
having
the
time
of
his
life
on
stage
with
guitar
in
his
hands
played
crucial
role
in
positioning
the
guitar
as
the
instrument
that
best
captured
the
style
and
spirit
of
this

music

On
April
Presley
made
the
first
of
two
appearances
on
NBC
Milton
Berle
Show
His
performance
on
the
deck
of
the
USS

in
San

prompted
cheers
and
screams
from
an
audience
of
sailors
and

Twelve
weeks
after

hit
In
late
April
Presley
began
two
week
residency
at
the
New
Frontier
Hotel
and
Casino
on
the
Las
Vegas
Strip
The
shows
were
poorly
received
by
the
conservative
middle
aged
hotel
guests
like
jug
of
corn
liquor
at
champagne
party
wrote
critic
for
Newsweek
Amid
his
Vegas
tenure
Presley
who
had
serious
acting
ambitions
signed
seven
year
contract
with
Paramount
Pictures
He
began
tour
of
the
Midwest
in
mid
May
taking
in
cities
in
as
many
days
He
had
attended
several
shows
by
Freddie
Bell
and

Bellboys
in
Vegas
and
was
struck
by
their
cover
of
Hound

in
for

by
songwriters

After

in

Crosse
Wisconsin
an
urgent
message
on
the
letterhead
of
the
local
Catholic
diocese
newspaper
was
sent
to
FBI
director
Edgar
Hoover
It
warned
that
Presley
is
definite
danger
to
the
security
of
the
United
States
His
actions
and
motions
were
such
as
to
rouse
the
sexual
passions
of
teenaged
youth
After
the
show
more
than
teenagers
tried
to
gang
into
Presley
room
at
the
auditorium
Indications
of
the
harm
Presley
did
just
in
La
Crosse
were
the
two
high
school
girls
whose
abdomen
and
thigh
had
Presley
autograph
The
second
Milton
Berle
Show
appearance
came
on
June
at
NBC
Hollywood
studio
amid
another
hectic
tour
Berle
persuaded
the
singer
to
leave
his
guitar
backstage
advising
Let
em
see
you
son
During
the
performance
Presley
abruptly
halted
an
uptempo
rendition
of
Hound
Dog
with
wave
of
his
arm
and
launched
into
slow
grinding
version
accentuated
with
energetic
exaggerated
body
movements
Presley
gyrations
created
storm
of
controversy
Television
critics
were
outraged
Jack
Gould
of
The
New
York
Times
wrote
Mr
Presley
has
no
discernible
singing
ability
His
phrasing
if
it
can
be
called
that
consists
of
the
stereotyped
variations
that
go
with
beginner

His
one
specialty
is
an
accented
movement
of
the
body
primarily
identified
with
the
repertoire
of
the
blond

of
the
burlesque
runway
Ben
Gross
of
the
New

Daily
News
opined
that
popular
music
has
reached
its
lowest
depths
in
the
grunt
and
groin
antics
of
one
Elvis
Presley
Elvis
who
rotates
his

gave
an
exhibition
that
was
suggestive
and
vulgar
tinged
with
the
kind
of
animalism
that
should

Ed

To
Presley
displeasure
he
soon

than
minute
to

wearing

and

As
described
by
television
historian
Jake
Austen
Allen
thought
Presley
was
talentless
and
absurd
he
set
things
up
so
that
Presley
would
show
his
contrition
Allen
for
his
part
later
wrote
that
he
found
Presley
strange
gangly
country
boy
charisma
his
hard
to
define
cuteness
and
his
charming
eccentricity
intriguing
and
simply
worked
the
singer
into
the
customary
comedy
fabric
of
his
program
Just
before
the
final
rehearsal
for
the
show
Presley
told
reporter
holding
down
on
this
show
don
want
to
do
anything
to
make
people
dislike
me
think
TV
is
important
so
going
to
go
along
but
won
be
able
to
give
the
kind
of
show
do
in
personal
appearance
Presley
would
refer
back
to
the
Allen
show
as
the
most
ridiculous
performance
of
his
career
Later
that
night
he
appeared
on
Hy
Gardner
Calling
popular
local
TV
show
Pressed
on
whether
he
had
learned
anything
from
the
criticism
to
which
he
was
being
subjected
Presley
responded
No
haven
don
feel
like
doing
anything
wrong
don
see
how
any
type
of
music
would
have
any
bad
influence
on
people
when
it
only
music
mean
how
would
rock
roll
music
make
anyone
rebel
against
their
parents
The
next
day
Presley
recorded
Hound
Dog
along
with
Any

You
Want

and
Don

The
Jordanaires
sang

as
they

would
work
with
Presley
through
the
few
days
later
the
singer
made
an
outdoor
concert
appearance
in
Memphis
at
which
he
announced
You
know
those
people
in
New

are
not
gonna
change
me
none
gonna
show
you
what
the
real
Elvis
is
like
tonight
In
August
judge
in
Jacksonville
Florida
ordered
Presley
to
tame
his
act
Throughout
the
following
performance
he
largely
kept
still
except
for
wiggling
his
little
finger
suggestively
in
mockery
of
the
order
The
single
pairing
Don

with
Hound

the

of

Watching

had
opined

it

The
audience
response
at
Presley
live
shows
became
increasingly
fevered
Moore
recalled
He
start
out
You
ain
nothin
but
Hound
Dog
and
they
just
go
to
pieces
They
always
react
the
same
way
There
be
riot
every
time
At
the
two
concerts
he
performed
in
September
at

Mississippi
Alabama

Elvis
Presley
second
album
was
released
in
October
and
quickly
rose
to
number
one
The
album
includes
Old
Shep
which
he
sang
at
the
talent
show
in
and
which
now
marked
the
first
time
he
played
piano
on
an
RCA
session
According
to
Guralnick
one
can
hear
in
the
halting
chords
and
the
somewhat
stumbling
rhythm
both
the
unmistakable
emotion
and
the
equally
unmistakable
valuing
of
emotion
over
technique
Assessing
the
musical
and
cultural
impact
of
Presley
recordings
from
That
All
Right
through
Elvis
rock
critic
Dave
Marsh
wrote
that
these
records
more
than
any
others
contain
the
seeds
of
what
rock
roll
was
has
been
and
most
likely
what
it
may
foreseeably
become
Presley
returned
to
the
Sullivan
show
at
its
main
studio
in
New
York
hosted
this
time
by
its
namesake
on
October
After
the
performance
crowds
in
Nashville
and
St
Louis
burned
him
in
effigy
His
first
motion
picture
Love
Me
Tender
was
released
on
November
Though
he
was
not
top
billed
the
film
original
title
The
Reno
Brothers
was
changed
to
capitalize
on
his
latest
number
one
record
Love
Me
Tender
had
hit
the
top
of
the
charts
earlier
that
month
To
further
take
advantage
of
Presley
popularity
four
musical
numbers
were
added
to
what
was
originally
straight
acting
role
The
film
was
panned
by
the
critics
but
did
very
well
at
the
box
office
Presley
would
receive
top
billing
on
every
subsequent
film
he
made
On
December
Presley
dropped
into
Sun
Records
where
Carl
Perkins
and
Jerry
Lee
Lewis
were
recording
and
jammed
with
them
Though
Phillips
no
longer
had
the
right
to
release
any
Presley
material
he
made
sure
the
session
was
captured
on
tape
The
results
none
officially
released
for
years
became
known
as
the
Million
Dollar
Quartet
recordings
Johnny
Cash
was
long
thought
to
have
played
as
well
but
was
present
just
briefly
at
Phillips
instigation
for
photo
opportunity
The
year
ended
with
front
page
story
in
The
Wall
Street
Journal
reporting
that
Presley
merchandise
had
brought
in
million
on
top
of
his

and
Billboard
declaration
that
he
had
placed
more
songs
in
the
top
than
any
other
artist
since
records
were
first
charted
In
his
first
full

of
the

on
this
occasion
indeed
shot

down
to

Some
commentators
have
claimed
that
Parker
orchestrated
an
appearance
of
censorship
to
generate
publicity
In
any
event
as
critic
Greil
Marcus
describes
Presley
did
not
tie
himself
down
Leaving
behind
the
bland
clothes
he
had
worn
on
the
first
two
shows
he
stepped
out
in
the
outlandish
costume
of
pasha
if
not

girl
From
the
make
up
over
his
eyes
the
hair
falling
in
his
face
the
overwhelmingly
sexual
cast
of
his
mouth
he
was
playing
Rudolph
Valentino
in
The
Sheik
with
all
stops
out
To
close
displaying
his
range
and
defying
Sullivan
wishes
Presley
sang
gentle
black
spiritual
Peace
in
the
Valley
At
the
end
of
the
show
Sullivan
declared
Presley
real
decent
fine
boy
Two
days
later
the
Memphis
draft
board
announced
that
Presley
would
be
classified
and
would
probably
be
drafted
sometime
that
year
Each
of
the
three
Presley
singles
released
in
the
first
half
of
went
to
number
one
Too

All
Shook
Up

Already
an
international

he
was
attracting

even
where
his

was
not
officially
released
Under

The
New

reported
that
pressings
of
his
music
on
discarded
ray
plates
were
commanding
high
prices
in
Leningrad
Between
film
shoots
and
recording
sessions
the
singer
also
found
time
to
purchase
an

eight
miles
km
south
of

for

and
his

Graceland
Loving
You
the
soundtrack
to
his
second
film
released
in
July
was
Presley
third
straight
number
one
album
The
title
track
was
written
by
Leiber
and
Stoller
who
were
then
retained
to
write
four
of
the
six
songs
recorded
at
the
sessions
for
Jailhouse
Rock
Presley
next
film
The
songwriting
team
effectively
produced
the
Jailhouse
sessions
and
developed
close
working
relationship
with
Presley
who
came
to
regard
them
as
his
good
luck
charm
He
was
fast
said
Leiber
Any

Frank

who
had
famously
inspired
the
swooning
of
teenage
girls
in
the
condemned
the
new
musical
phenomenon
In
magazine
article
he
decried
rock
and
roll
as
brutal
ugly
degenerate
vicious
It
fosters
almost
totally
negative
and
destructive
reactions
in
young
people
It
smells
phoney

false
It
is

and

by

goons
This
rancid

aphrodisiac
deplore
Asked
for
response
Presley
said
admire
the
man
He
has
right
to
say
what
he
wants
to
say
He
is
great
success
and
fine
actor
but
think
he
shouldn
have
said
it
This
is
trend
just
the
same
as
he
faced
when
he
started
years
ago
Leiber
and
Stoller
were
again
in
the
studio
for
the
recording
of
Elvis
Christmas
Album
Toward
the
end
of
the
session
they
wrote
song
on
the
spot
at
Presley
request
Santa
Claus
Is
Back
in
Town
an
innuendo
laden
blues
The
holiday
release
stretched
Presley
string
of
number
one
albums
to
four
and
would
become
the
best
selling
Christmas
album
ever
in
the
United
States
with
eventual
sales
of
over
million
worldwide
After
the
session

and
Black

resigned
Though
they
were

few
weeks
later
it
was
clear
that
they
had
not
been
part
of
Presley
inner
circle
for
some
time
On
December
Presley
received
his

He

Recording

in
mid
January
Leiber
and
Stoller
provided
three
songs
and
were
again
on

but
it
would
be
the
last
time
they
and
Presley
worked
closely
together
As
Stoller
recalled

He

On
March
Presley
was

into
the
Army
as
private
at
Fort

near
Fort

His

was

event
Hundreds
of

descended
on
Presley

then

in

Two
days
later
she
died
of

failure
aged
Presley
was
devastated
their
relationship
had
remained
extremely
close
even
into
his
adulthood
they
would
use
baby
talk
with
each
other
and
Presley
would
address
her
with
pet
names
Vernon
and
Gladys
Presley
with
Elvis
at
his
Army
induction
After
training
Presley
joined
the
rd
Armored
Division
in
Friedberg
Germany
on
October
While
on
maneuvers
Presley
was
introduced
to
amphetamines
by
sergeant
He
became
practically
evangelical
about
their
benefits
attribution
needed
not
only
for
energy
but
for
strength
and
weight
loss
as
well
and
many
of
his
friends
in
the
outfit
joined
him
in
indulging
The
Army
also
introduced
Presley
to
karate
which
he
studied
seriously
training
with
rgen
Seydel
and
later
included
in
his
live
performances
and
became
lifelong
intrest
Fellow
soldiers
have
attested
to
Presley
wish
to
be
seen
as
an
able
ordinary
soldier
despite
his
fame
and
to
his
generosity
He
donated
his
Army
pay
to
charity
purchased
TV
sets
for
the
base
and
bought
an
extra
set
of
fatigues
for
everyone
in
his
outfit
While
in
Friedberg
Presley
met
year
old
Priscilla
Beaulieu
They
would
eventually
marry
after
seven
and
half
year
courtship
In
her
autobiography
Priscilla
says
that
Presley
was
concerned
that
his
month
spell
as
would
ruin
his
career
In
Special
Services
he
would
have
been
able
to
give
musical
performances
and
remain
in
touch
with
the
public
but
Parker
had
convinced
him
that
to
gain
popular
respect
he
should
serve
his
country
as
regular
soldier
Media
reports
echoed
Presley
concerns
about
his
career
but
RCA
producer
Steve
Sholes
and
Freddy
Bienstock
of
Hill
and
Range
had
carefully
prepared
for
his
two
year
hiatus
Armed
with
substantial
amount
of
unreleased
material
they
kept
up
regular
stream
of
successful

honorably
discharged
three
days
later

The
train
that
carried
him
from

was
called

Something
for
Everybody
As
described
by
John
Robertson
it
exemplifies
the
Nashville
sound
the
restrained
cosmopolitan
style
that
would
define
country
music
in
the
Presaging
much
of
what
was
to
come
from
Presley
himself
over
the
next
half
decade
the
album
is
largely
pleasant
unthreatening
pastiche
of
the
music
that
had
once
been
Elvis
birthright
attribution
needed
It
would
be
his
sixth
number
one
LP
Another
benefit
concert
raising
money
for

memorial
was
staged
on
March
in
Hawaii
It
was
to
be
Presley
last
public
performance
for
seven
years
Lost
in
Hollywood
Parker
had
by
now
pushed
Presley
into
heavy
film
making
schedule
focused
on
formulaic
modestly
budgeted
musical
comedies
Presley
at
first
insisted
on
pursuing
more
serious
roles
but
when
two
films
in
more
dramatic
vein
Flaming
Star
and
Wild
in
the
Country
were
less
commercially
successful
he
reverted
to
the
formula
Among
the
movies
he
made
during
the
there
were
few
further
exceptions
His
films
were
almost
universally
panned
critic
Andrew
Caine
dismissed
them
as
pantheon
of
bad
taste
Nonetheless
they
were
virtually
all
profitable
Hal
Wallis
who
produced
nine
of
them
declared
Presley
picture
is
the
only
sure
thing
in
Hollywood
Of
Presley
films
in
the
were
accompanied
by
soundtrack
albums
and
another
by
soundtrack
EPs
The
movies
rapid
production
and
release
schedules
he
frequently
starred
in
three
year
affected
his
music
According
to
Jerry
Leiber
the
soundtrack
formula
was
already
evident
before
Presley
left
for
the
Army
three
ballads
one
medium
tempo
number
one
up
tempo
and
one
break
blues
boogie
As
the
decade
wore
on
the
quality
of
the
soundtrack
songs
grew
progressively
worse
Julie
Parrish
who
appeared
in
Paradise
Hawaiian
Style
says
that
he
hated
many
of
the
songs
chosen
for
his
films
The
Jordanaires
Gordon
Stoker
describes
how
Presley
would
retreat
from
the
studio
microphone
The
material
was
so
bad
that
he
felt
like
he
couldn
sing
it
Most
of
the
movie
albums
featured
song
or
two
from
respected
writers
such
as
the
team
of
Doc
Pomus
and
Mort
Shuman
But
by
and
large
according
to
biographer
Jerry
Hopkins
the
numbers
seemed
to
be
written
on
order
by
men
who
never
really
understood
Elvis
or
rock
and
roll
Regardless
of
the
songs
quality
it
has
been
argued
that
Presley
generally
sang
them
well
with
commitment
Critic
Dave
Marsh
heard
the
opposite
Presley
isn
trying
probably
the
wisest
course
in
the
face
of
material
like
No
Room
to
Rumba
in
Sports
Car
and
Rock
Hula
Baby
In
the
first
half
of
the
decade
three
of
Presley
soundtrack
albums
hit
number
one
on
the
pop
charts
and
few
of
his
most
popular
songs
came
from
his
films
such
as
Can
Help
Falling
in

the
title

was
minor
hit
as
side
and
became

only
later
But
as
with

the

steadily
diminished

that
signaled
his
comeback
only
one
LP
of
new

by
Presley
was
issued
the
gospel
album
How
Great
Thou
Art
It
won
him
his
first
Grammy
Award
for
Best
Sacred
Performance
As
Marsh
described
Presley
was
arguably
the
greatest
white
gospel
singer
of
his
time
and
really
the
last
rock
roll
artist
to
make
gospel
as
vital
component
of
his
musical
personality
as
his
secular
songs
Shortly
before
Christmas
more
than
seven
years
since
they
first
met
Presley
proposed
to
Priscilla
Beaulieu
They
were
married
on
May
in

ceremony
in

The

It
was
not
until
October
when
the
Clambake

low

that
RCA

recognized
problem
By
then
of

the
damage
had
been
done
as
historians
Connie
Kirchberg

Marc

put

Elvis
was
viewed
as

The

produced
one
of
the
most
famous
images
of
Presley
Taken
on
June
it
was
adapted
for
the
cover
of
Rolling
Stone
in
July
Presley
only
child
Lisa
Marie
was
born
on
February
during
period
when
he
had
grown
deeply
unhappy
with
his
career
Of
the
eight
Presley
singles
released
between
January
and
May
only
two
charted
in
the
top
and
none
higher
than
number
His
forthcoming
soundtrack
album
Speedway
would
die
at
number
on
the
Billboard
chart
Parker
had
already
shifted
his
plans
to
television
where
Presley
had
not
appeared
since
the
Sinatra
Timex
show
in
He
maneuvered
deal
with
NBC
that
committed
the
network
to
both
finance

feature
and
broadcast
Christmas
special
Recorded
in
late
June
in
Burbank
California
the
special
called
simply
Elvis
aired
on
December
Later
known
as
the

the
show
featured
lavishly
staged
studio
productions
as
well
as
songs
performed
with
band
in
front
of
small
audience
Presley
first
live
performances
since
The
live
segments
saw
Presley
clad
in
tight
black
leather
singing
and
playing
guitar
in
an
uninhibited
style
reminiscent
of
his
early
rock
and
roll
days
Director
and
coproducer
Steve
Binder
had
worked
hard
to
reassure
the
nervous
singer
and
to
produce
show
that
was
far
from
the
hour
of
Christmas
songs
Parker
had
originally
planned
The
show
NBC
highest
rated
that
season
captured

of
the
total

Jon
Landau
of
Eye
magazine
remarked
There
is
something
magical
about
watching
man
who
has
lost
himself
find
his
way
back
home
He
sang
with
the
kind
of
power
people
no
longer
expect
of
rock
roll
singers
He
moved
his
body
with
lack
of
pretension
and
effort
that
must
have
made
Jim
Morrison
green
with
envy
Dave
Marsh
calls
the
performance
one
of
emotional
grandeur
and
historical
resonance
By
January
the
single
If
Can
Dream
written
for
the
special
reached
number
The
soundtrack
album
broke
into
the
top

According
to
friend
Jerry
Schilling
the
special
reminded
Presley
of
what
he
had
not
been
able
to
do
for
years
being
able
to
choose
the
people
being
able
to
choose
what
songs
and
not
being

what
had
to

commented

about

the

incredible
is
his

mentioned
to

that
smoked

and
he
was
just
appalled
He
said

In

In

footage
at

during

for
the
documentary
Elvis
That
the
Way
It
Is
Presley
was
by
now
performing
in
jumpsuit
which
would
become
trademark
of
his
live
act
During
this
engagement
he
was
threatened
with
murder
unless
was
paid
Presley
had
been
the
target
of
many
threats
since
the
often
without
his
knowledge
The
FBI
took
the
threat
seriously
and
security
was
stepped
up
for
the
next
two
shows
Presley
went
onstage
with
Derringer
in
his
right
boot
and
pistol
in
his
waistband
but
the
concerts
went
off
without
incident
The
album
That
the
Way
It
Is
produced
to
accompany
the
documentary
and
featuring
both
studio
and
live
recordings
marked
stylistic
shift
As
music
historian
John
Robertson
notes
The
authority
of
Presley
singing
helped
disguise
the
fact
that
the
album
stepped
decisively
away
from
the
American
roots
inspiration
of
the
Memphis
sessions
towards
more
middle
of
the
road
sound
With
country
put
on
the
back
burner
and
soul
and
left
in
Memphis
what
was
left
was
very
classy
very
clean
white
pop
perfect
for
the
Las
Vegas
crowd
but
definite
retrograde
step
for
Elvis
After
the
end
of
his
International
engagement
on
September
Presley
embarked
on
week
long
concert
tour
largely

in

Oval
Office
December
On
December
Presley
engineered
meeting
with
President
Richard
Nixon
at
the
White
House
where
he
expressed
his
patriotism
and
explained
how
he
believed
he
could
reach
out
to
the
hippies
to
help
combat
the
drug
culture
he
and
the
president
abhorred
He
asked
Nixon
for

and
Dangerous
Drugs
badge
to
add
to
similar
items
he
had
begun
collecting
and
to
signify
official
sanction
of
his
patriotic
efforts
Nixon
who
apparently
found
the
encounter
awkward
expressed
belief
that
Presley
could
send
positive
message
to
young
people
and
that
it
was
therefore
important
he
retain
his
credibility
Presley
told
Nixon
that
The
Beatles
whose
songs
he
regularly
performed
in
concert
during
the
era
exemplified
what
he
saw
as
trend
of
anti
Americanism
Presley
and
his
friends
had
had
four
hour
get
together
with
The
Beatles
five
years
earlier
On
hearing
reports
of
the
meeting
Paul
McCartney
later
said
that
he
felt
bit
betrayed
The
great
joke
was
that
we
were
taking
illegal
drugs
and
look

happened
to
him

According
to

never

At

whether

with

Presley
replied
Well
the

is
one
thing
and
the
human
being
another
it
very
hard
to
live
up
to
an
image
In

people
would
be
broadly
accepted
but
that
figure
appears
to
have
been
sheer
invention
Presley
stage
costume
became
the
most
recognized
example
of
the
elaborate
concert
garb
with
which
his
latter
day
persona
became
closely
associated
As
described
by
Bobbie
Ann
Mason
At
the
end
of
the
show
when
he
spreads
out
his
American
Eagle
cape
with
the
full
stretched
wings
of
the
eagle
studded
on
the
back
he
becomes
god
figure
The
accompanying
double
album
released
in
February
went
to
number
one
and
eventually
sold
over
million
copies
in
the
United
States
It
proved
to
be
Presley
last
number
one
pop
album
during
his
lifetime
At
midnight
show
the
same
month
four
men
rushed
onto
the
stage
in
an
apparent
attack
Security
men
leapt
to
Presley
defense
and
the
singer
karate
instinct
took
over
as
he
ejected
one
invader
from
the
stage
himself
Following
the
show
he
became
obsessed
with
the
idea
that
the
men
had
been
sent
by
Mike
Stone
to
kill
him
Though
they
were
shown
to
have
been
only
overexuberant
fans
he
raged
There
too
much
pain
in
me
Stone
must
die
His
outbursts
continued
with
such
intensity
that
physician
was
unable
to
calm
him
despite
administering
large
doses
of
medication
After
another
two
full
days
of
raging
Red
West
his
friend
and
bodyguard
felt
compelled
to
get
price
for
contract
killing
and
was
relieved
when
Presley
decided
Aw
hell
let
just
leave
it
for
now
Maybe
it
bit
heavy
Health
deterioration
and
death
Medical
crises
and
last
studio
sessions
Presley
divorce
took
effect
on
October
He
was
now
becoming
increasingly
unwell
Twice
during
the
year
he
overdosed
on
barbiturates
spending
three
days
in
coma
in
his
hotel
suite
after
the
first
incident
Toward
the
end
of
he
was
hospitalized
semicomatose
from
the
effects
of
pethidine
addiction
According
to
his
primary
care
physician
Dr
George
Nichopoulos
Presley
felt
that
by
getting
drugs
from
doctor
he
wasn
the
common
everyday
junkie
getting
something
off
the
street
Since
his
comeback
he
had
staged
more
live
shows
with
each
passing
year
and
saw
concerts
his
busiest
schedule
ever
Despite
his
failing
health
in
he
undertook
another
intensive
touring
schedule
Presley
condition
declined
precipitously
in
September
Keyboardist
Tony
Brown
remembers
the
singer
arrival
at
University
of
Maryland
concert
He
fell
out
of
the
limousine
to
his
knees
People
jumped
to
help
and
he
pushed
them
away
like
Don
help
me
He
walked
on
stage
and
held
onto
the
mike
for
the
first
thirty
minutes
like
it
was
post
Everybody
looking
at
each
other
like
Is
the
tour
gonna
happen
Guitarist
John
Wilkinson
recalled
He
was
all
gut
He
was
slurring
He
was
so
fucked
up
It
was
obvious
he
was
drugged
It
was
obvious
there
was
something
terribly
wrong
with
his
body
It
was
so
bad
the
words
to
the
songs
were
barely
intelligible
remember
crying
He
could
barely
get
through
the
introductions
Wilkinson
recounted
that
few
nights
later
in
Detroit
watched
him
in
his
dressing
room
just
draped
over
chair
unable
to
move
So
often
thought
Boss
why
don
you
just
cancel
this
tour
and
take
year
off
mentioned
something
once
in
guarded
moment
He
patted
me
on
the
back
and
said
It
ll
be
all
right
Don
you
worry
about
it
Presley
continued
to
play
to
sellout
crowds
As
cultural
critic
Marjorie
Garber
describes
he
was
now
widely
seen
as
garish
pop
crooner
in
effect
he
had
become
Liberace
Even
his
fans
were
now
middle
aged
matrons
and
blue
haired
grandmothers
On
July
Vernon
Presley
who
had
become
deeply
involved
in
his
son
financial
affairs
fired
Memphis
Mafia
bodyguards
Red
West
Presley
friend
since
the
Sonny
West
and
David
Hebler
citing
the
need
to
cut
back
on
expenses
Presley
was
in
Palm
Springs
at
the
time
and
some
suggest
the
singer
was
too
cowardly
to
face
the
three
himself
Another
associate
of
Presley
John
Grady
argued
that
the
bodyguards
were
dropped
because
their
rough
treatment
of
fans
had
prompted
too
many
lawsuits
However
Presley
stepbrother
David
Stanley
has
claimed
that
the
bodyguards
were
fired
because
they
were
becoming
more
outspoken
about
Presley
drug
dependency
RCA
which
had
enjoyed
steady
stream
of
product
from
Presley
for
over
decade
grew
anxious
as
his
interest
in
spending
time
in
the
studio
waned
After
December
session
that
produced
songs
enough
for
almost
two
albums
he
did
not
enter
the
studio
in
Parker
sold
RCA
on
another
concert
record
Elvis
Recorded
Live
on
Stage
in
Memphis
Recorded
on
March
it
included
version
of
How
Great

that
would
win
Presley
his
third
and
final
competitive
Grammy
Award
All
three
of
his
competitive
Grammy
wins
out
of
total
nominations
were
for
gospel
recordings
Presley
returned
to
the
studio
in
Hollywood
in
March
but
Parker
attempts
to
arrange
another
session
toward
the
end
of
the
year
were
unsuccessful
In
RCA
sent

that
made
possible
two
full

Even
in

For
all
the
concerns
of
his
label
and
manager
in
studio
sessions
between
July
and
October
Presley
recorded
virtually
the
entire
contents
of
six
albums
Though
he
was
no
longer
major
presence
on
the

five
of

The
story
was
similar
with
his
singles
there
were
no
major
pop
hits
but
Presley
was
significant
force
in
not
just
the
country
market
but
on
adult

as

from
this

of

with
what

as

that
he

Final

Presley
and

to
Alden
and

ring
two
months
later
though
several
of
his
friends
later
claimed
that
he
had
no
serious
intention
of
marrying
again
Journalist
Tony
Scherman
writes
that
by
early
Presley
had
become
grotesque
caricature
of
his
sleek
energetic
former
self
Hugely
overweight
his
mind
dulled
by
the
pharmacopia
he
daily
ingested
he
was
barely
able
to
pull
himself
through
his
abbreviated
concerts
In
Alexandria
Louisiana
the
singer
was
on
stage
for
less
than
an
hour
and
was
impossible
to
understand
On
March
Presley
failed
to
perform
in
Baton
Rouge
unable
to
get
out
of
his
hotel
bed
total
of
four
shows
had
to
be
cancelled
and
rescheduled
Despite
the
accelerating
deterioration
of
his
health
he
stuck
to
most
touring
commitments
According
to
Guralnick
fans
were
becoming
increasingly
voluble
about
their
disappointment
but
it
all
seemed
to
go
right
past
Presley
whose
world
was
now
confined
almost
entirely
to
his
room
and
his
spiritualism
books
cousin
Billy
Smith
recalled
how
Presley
would
sit
in
his
room
and
chat
for
hours
sometimes
recounting
favorite
Monty
Python
sketches
and
his
own
past
escapades
but
more
often
gripped
by
paranoid
obsessions

Questions
over
cause
of
death
While
an
autopsy
undertaken
the
same
day
Presley
died
was
still
in
progress
Memphis
medical
examiner
Dr
Jerry
Francisco
announced
that
the
immediate
cause
of
death
was
cardiac
arrest
Asked
if
drugs
were
involved
he
declared
that
drugs
played
no
role
in
Presley
death
In
fact
drug
use
was
heavily
implicated
in
Presley
death
writes
Guralnick
The
pathologists
conducting
the
autopsy
thought
it
possible
for
instance
that
he
had
suffered
anaphylactic
shock
brought
on
by
the
codeine
pills
he
had
gotten
from
his
dentist
to
which
he
was
known
to
have
had
mild
allergy
pair
of
lab
reports
filed
two
months
later
strongly
suggested
that
polypharmacy
was
the
primary
cause
of
death
one
reported
fourteen
drugs
in
Elvis
system
ten
in
significant
quantity
In
forensic
pathologist
Cyril
Wecht
conducted
review
of
the
reports
and
concluded
that
combination
of
central
nervous
system
depressants
had
resulted
in
Presley
accidental
death
Forensic
historian
and
pathologist
Michael
Baden
viewed
the
situation
as
complicated
Elvis
had
had
an
enlarged
heart
for
long
time
That
together
with
his
drug
habit
caused
his
death
But
he
was
difficult
to
diagnose
it
was
judgment
call
The
competence
and
ethics
of
two
of
the
centrally
involved
medical
professionals
were
seriously
questioned
Dr
Francisco
had
offered
cause
of
death
before
the
autopsy
was
complete
claimed
the
underlying
ailment
was
cardiac
arrhythmia
condition
that
can
be
determined
only
in
someone
who
is
still
alive
and
denied
drugs
played
any
part
in
Presley
death
before
the
toxicology
results
were
known
Allegations
of
cover
up
were
widespread
While
trial
of
Presley
main
physician
Dr
George
Nichopoulos
exonerated
him
of
criminal
liability
for
the
singer
death
the
facts
were
startling
In
the
first
eight
months
of
alone
he
had
prescribed
more
than
doses
of
sedatives
amphetamines
and
narcotics
all
in
Elvis
name
His
license
was
suspended
for
three
months
It
was
permanently
revoked
in
the
after
the
Tennessee
Medical
Board
brought
new
charges
of
over
prescription
In
the
Presley
autopsy
was
reopened
Dr
Joseph
Davis
who
had
conducted
thousands
of
autopsies
as
Miami
Dade
County
coroner
declared
at
its
completion
There
is
nothing
in
any
of
the
data
that
supports
death
from
drugs
In
fact
everything
points
to
sudden
violent
heart
attack
In
Dr
Forest
Tennant
who
had
testified
as
defense
witness
in
Nichopoulos
trial
described
his
own
analysis
of
all
of
Presley
available
medical
records
He
concluded
that
Presley
drug
abuse
had
led
to
falls
head
trauma
and
overdoses
that
damaged
his
brain
and
that
his
death
was
due
in
part
to
toxic
reaction
to
codeine
exacerbated
by
an
undetected
liver
enzyme
defect
which
can
cause
sudden
cardiac
arrhythmia
DNA
analysis
in
of
hair
sample
purported
to
be
Presley
found
evidence
of
genetic
variants
that
can
lead
to
glaucoma
migraines
and
obesity
crucial
variant
associated
with
the
heart
muscle
disease
hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy
was
also
identified

Guest
House
at
Graceland
For
much
of
his
adult
life
Presley
with
his
rise
from
poverty
to
riches
and
massive
fame
had
seemed
to
epitomize
the
American
Dream
In
his
final
years
and
even
more
so
after
his
death
and
the
revelations
about
its
circumstances
he
became
symbol
of
excess
and
gluttony
as
well
Increasing
attention
for
instance
was
paid
to
his
appetite
for
the
rich
heavy
Southern
cooking
of
his
upbringing
foods
such
as
chicken
fried
steak
and
biscuits
and
gravy
In
particular
his
love
of
calorie
laden
fried
peanut
butter
banana
and
sometimes
bacon
sandwiches
now
known
as
Elvis
sandwiches
came
to
stand
for
this
aspect
of
his
persona
But
the
Elvis
sandwich
represents
more
than
just
unhealthy
overindulgence
as
media
and
culture
scholar
Robert
Thompson
describes
the
unsophisticated
treat
also
signifies
Presley
enduring
all
American
appeal
He
wasn
only
the
king
he
was
one
of
us
Since
there
have
been
numerous
alleged
sightings
of
Presley
long
standing
conspiracy
theory
among
some
fans
is
that
he
faked
his
death
Adherents
cite
alleged
discrepancies
in
the
death
certificate
reports
of
wax
dummy
in
his
original
coffin
and
accounts
of
Presley
planning
diversion
so
he
could
retire
in
peace
An
unusually
large
number
of
fans
have
domestic
shrines
devoted
to
Presley
and
journey
to
sites
with
which
he
is
connected
however
faintly
Every
August
the
anniversary
of
his
death
thousands
of
people
gather
outside
Graceland
and
celebrate
his
memory
with
candlelight
ritual
With
Elvis
it
is
not
just
his
music
that
has
survived
death
writes
Ted
Harrison
He
himself
has
been
raised
like
medieval
saint
to
figure
of
cultic
status
It
is
as
if
he
has
been
canonized
by
acclamation
Artistry
Influences
Presley
earliest
musical
influence
came
from
gospel
His
mother
recalled
that
from
the
age
of
two
at
the
Assembly
of
God
church
in
Tupelo
attended
by
the
family
he
would
slide
down
off
my
lap
run
into
the
aisle
and
scramble
up
to
the
platform
There
he
would
stand
looking
at
the
choir
and
trying
to
sing
with
them
In
Memphis
Presley
frequently
attended
all
night
gospel
singings
at
the
Ellis
Auditorium
where
groups
such
as
the
Statesmen
Quartet
led
the
music
in
style
that
Guralnick
suggests
sowed
the
seeds
of
Presley
future
stage
act
The
Statesmen
were
an
electric
combination
featuring
some
of
the
most
thrillingly
emotive
singing
and
daringly
unconventional
showmanship
in
the
entertainment
world
dressed
in
suits
that
might
have
come
out
of
the
window
of
Lansky
Bass
singer
Jim
Wetherington
known
universally
as
the
Big
Chief
maintained
steady
bottom
ceaselessly
jiggling
first
his
left
leg
then
his
right
with
the
material
of
the
pants
leg
ballooning
out
and
shimmering
He
went
about
as
far
as
you
could
go
in
gospel
music
said
Jake
Hess
The
women
would
jump
up
just
like
they
do
for
the
pop
shows
Preachers
frequently
objected
to
the
lewd
movements
but
audiences
reacted
with
screams
and
swoons
As
teenager
Presley
musical
interests
were
wide
ranging
and
he
was
deeply
informed
about
African
American
musical
idioms
as
well
as
white
ones
see
Teenage
life
in
Memphis
Though
he
never
had
any
formal
training
he
was
blessed
with
remarkable
memory
and
his
musical
knowledge
was
already
considerable
by
the
time
he
made
his
first
professional
recordings
in
at
the
age

When
Jerry
Leiber
and
Mike
Stoller
met
him
two
years
later
they
were
astonished
at
his
encyclopedic
understanding
of
the
blues
and
as
Stoller
put
it
He
certainly
knew
lot
more
than
we
did
about
country
music
and
gospel
music
At
press
conference
the
following
year
he
proudly
declared

Presley
was
central
figure
in
the
development
of
rockabilly
according
to

Rockabilly

writes
Craig
Morrison
Paul
Friedlander
describes
the
defining
elements
of
rockabilly
which
he
similarly
characterizes
as
essentially
an
Elvis
Presley
construction
the
raw
emotive
and
slurred
vocal
style
and
emphasis
on
rhythmic
feeling
of

It
had
been
there
for
quite
while
really
Carl
Perkins
was
doing
basically
the
same
sort
of
thing
up
around
Jackson
and
know
for
fact
Jerry
Lee
Lewis
had
been
playing
that
kind
of
music
ever
since
he
was
ten
years
old
At
RCA
Presley
rock
and
roll
sound
grew
distinct
from
rockabilly
with
group
chorus
vocals
more
heavily
amplified
electric
guitars
and
tougher
more
intense
manner
While
he
was
known
for
taking
songs
from
various
sources
and
giving
them
rockabilly
rock
and
roll
treatment
he
also
recorded
songs
in
other
genres
from
early
in
his
career
from
the
pop
standard
Blue

to
the

After
his
return
from
military
service
in
Presley
continued
to
perform
rock
and
roll
but
the
characteristic
style
was
substantially
toned
down
His
first
post
Army
single

number
one
hit
Stuck

is
typical
of
this
shift

The

The
modern
blues
sound
captured
with
great
success
on
Elvis
Is
Back
was
essentially
abandoned
for
six
years
until
such
recordings
as
Down

the
Alley
and
Hi

The
singer
output
during
most
of
the
emphasized
pop
music
often

the
form

ballads
such
as

Lonesome

Now
or
Never
which
also
topped

year
was
classically
influenced
variation
of
pop
based
on
the
Neapolitan
sole
mio
and
concluding
with
full
voiced
operatic
cadence
These
were
both
dramatic
numbers
but
most
of
what
Presley
recorded
for
his
many
film
soundtracks
was
in
much
lighter
vein
While
Presley
performed
several
of
his
classic
ballads
for
the
Comeback
Special
the
sound
of
the
show
was
dominated
by
aggressive
rock
and
roll
He
would
record
few
new
straight
ahead
rock
and
roll
songs
thereafter
as
he
explained
they
were
hard
to
find
significant
exception
was
Burning
Love
his
last
major
hit
on
the
pop
charts
Like
his
work
of
the
Presley
subsequent
recordings
reworked
pop
and
country
songs
but
in
markedly
different
permutations
His
stylistic
range
now
began
to
embrace
more
contemporary
rock
sound
as
well
as
soul
and

The

by
critic
Dave
Marsh

from

thrilled
in
the
early
days
to
lower

perplexed
in
the

months
Marsh
credits
Presley

the

on

Jorgensen
calls
the

How

an

fulfillment
of
his
vocal
ambitions
as
Presley
crafted
for
himself
an
ad

arrangement
in

every
part

Guralnick

Stand

from
the
same

beautifully
articulated
almost
nakedly
yearning
performance
but
by
contrast
feels
that
Presley
reaches
beyond
his
powers
on
Where
No
One
Stands
Alone
resorting
to
kind
of
inelegant
bellowing
to
push
out
sound
that
Jake
Hess
of
the
Statesmen
Quartet
had
in
his
command
Hess
himself
thought
that
while
others
might
have
voices
the
equal
of
Presley
he
had
that
certain
something
that
everyone
searches
for
all
during
their
lifetime
Guralnick
attempts
to
pinpoint
that
something
The
warmth
of
his
voice
his
controlled
use
of
both
vibrato
technique
and
natural
falsetto
range
the
subtlety
and
deeply
felt
conviction
of
his
singing
were
all
qualities
recognizably
belonging
to
his
talent
but
just
as
recognizably
not
to
be
achieved
without
sustained
dedication
and
effort
Marsh
praises
his
reading
of
Male
bearing
down
on
the
hard
guy
lyrics
not
sending
them
up
or
overplaying
them
but
tossing
them
around
with
that
astonishingly
tough
yet
gentle
assurance
that
he
brought
to
his
Sun
records
The
performance
on
In
the
Ghetto
is
according
to
Jorgensen
devoid
of
any
of
his
characteristic
vocal
tricks
or
mannerisms
instead
relying
on
the
exceptional
clarity
and
sensitivity
of
his
voice
Guralnick
describes
the
song
delivery
as
of
almost
translucent
eloquence
so
quietly
confident
in
its
simplicity
On
Suspicious
Minds
Guralnick
hears
essentially
the
same
remarkable
mixture
of
tenderness
and
poise
but
supplemented
with
an
expressive
quality
somewhere
between
stoicism
at
suspected
infidelity
and
anguish
over
impending
loss
Music
critic
Henry
Pleasants
observes
that
Presley
has
been
described
variously
as
baritone
and
tenor
An
extraordinary
compass
and
very
wide
range
of
vocal
color
have
something
to
do
with
this
divergence
of
opinion
He
identifies
Presley
as
high
baritone
calculating
his
range
as
two
octaves
and
third
from
the
baritone
low
to
the
tenor
high
with
an
upward
extension
in
falsetto
to
at
least
flat
Presley
best
octave
is
in
the
middle
flat
to
flat
granting
an
extra
full
step
up
or
down
In
Pleasants
view
his
voice
was
variable
and
unpredictable
at
the
bottom
often
brilliant
at
the
top
with
the
capacity
for
full
voiced
high
Gs
and
As
that
an
opera
baritone
might
envy
Scholar
Lindsay
Waters
who
figures
Presley
range
as
two
and
quarter
octaves
emphasizes
that
his
voice
had
an
emotional
range
from
tender
whispers
to
sighs
down
to
shouts
grunts
grumbles
and
sheer
gruffness
that
could
move
the
listener
from
calmness
and
surrender
to
fear
His
voice
can
not
be
measured
in
octaves
but
in
decibels
even
that
misses
the
problem
of
how
to
measure
delicate
whispers
that
are
hardly
audible
at
all
Presley
was
always
able
to
duplicate
the
open
hoarse
ecstatic
screaming
shouting
wailing
reckless
sound
of
the
black
rhythm
and

and
gospel
singers
writes

also
demonstrated
remarkable
ability
to

many

many
listeners
who

to
ask

assumed
that
its
singer
was
black
From
the
beginning
of
his
national
fame
Presley
expressed
respect
for
African
American

their

disregard
for

norms
of

then

in

The
Memphis
World
an
African
American
newspaper
reported
that
Presley
the
rock
roll
phenomenon
cracked
Memphis
segregation
laws
by
attending
the
local
amusement
park
on
what
was
designated
as
its
colored
night
Such
statements
and
actions
led
Presley
to
be
generally
hailed
in
the
black
community
during
the
early
days
of
his
stardom
By
contrast
many
white
adults
according
to
Billboard
Arnold
Shaw
did
not
like
him
and
condemned
him
as
depraved
Anti
negro
prejudice
doubtless
figured
in
adult
antagonism
Regardless
of
whether
parents
were
aware
of
the
Negro
sexual
origins
of
the
phrase
rock

Presley
impressed
them
as
the
visual

the
largely
positive
view
of

held
by
African
Americans
rumor
spread
in

that
he
had
at

point
announced

Jet
Louie
Robinson
pursued
the
story
On

set
of
Jailhouse
Rock
Presley
granted
Robinson
an
interview
though
he
was
no
longer
dealing
with
the
mainstream
press
He
denied
making
such
statement
or
holding
in
any
way
to
its
racist
view
never
said
anything
like
that
and
people
who
know

know
that
wouldn
have
said
it
lot
of
people
seem
to
think
started
this
business
But
rock
roll
was
here
long
time
before
came
along
Nobody
can
sing

Let
face
it

can
know
that
Robinson
found
no
evidence
that
the
remark
had
ever
been
made
and
on
the
contrary
elicited
testimony
from
many
individuals
indicating
that
Presley
was
anything
but
racist
Blues
singer
Ivory
Joe
Hunter
who
had
heard
the
rumor
before
he
visited
Graceland
one
evening
reported
of
Presley
He
showed
me
every
courtesy
and
think
he
one
of
the
greatest
Though
the
rumored
remark
was
wholly
discredited
at
the
time
it
was
still
being
used
against
Presley
decades
later
The
identification
of
Presley
with
racism
either
personally
or
symbolically
was
expressed
most
famously
in
the
lyrics
of
the
rap
hit
Fight
the
Power
by
Public
Enemy
Elvis
was
hero
to
most
But
he
never
meant
shit
to
me
Straight
up
racist
that
sucker
was
Simple
and
plain
The
persistence
of
such
attitudes
was
fueled
by
resentment
over
the
fact
that
Presley
whose
musical
and
visual
performance
idiom
owed
much
to
African
American
sources
achieved
the
cultural
acknowledgement
and
commercial
success
largely
denied
his
black
peers
Into
the
st
century
the
notion
that
Presley
had
stolen
black
music
still
found
adherents
Notable
among
African
American
entertainers
expressly
rejecting
this
view
was
Jackie
Wilson
who
argued
lot
of
people
have
accused
Elvis
of
stealing

music
when
in
fact
almost
every
black
solo
entertainer
copied
his
stage
mannerisms
from
Elvis
And
throughout
his
career
Presley
plainly
acknowledged
his
debt
Addressing
his

audience
he
said

His

as

was

for
Presley
eroticized
image
Writing
in
critic
George
Melly
described
him
as
the
master
of
the
sexual
simile
treating
his
guitar
as
both
phallus
and
girl
In
his
Presley
obituary
Lester
Bangs
credited
him
as
the
man
who
brought
overt
blatant
vulgar
sexual
frenzy
to
the
popular
arts

that

While
Presley
was
marketed
as
an
icon
of
heterosexuality
some
cultural
critics
have
argued
that

was
ambiguous

spectacular
eroticization

homoeroticization

In

Elvis

an
ambivalent

as
well
Priscilla
Presley
noted
that
Elvis
detested
the
business
side
of
his
career
He
would
sign
contract
without
even
reading
it
Presley
friend
Marty
Lacker
regarded
Parker
as
hustler
and
con
artist
He
was
only
interested
in
now
money
get
the
buck
and
get
gone
Lacker
was
instrumental
in
convincing
Presley
to
record
with
Memphis
producer
Chips
Moman
and
his
handpicked
musicians
at
American
Sound
Studio
in
early
The
American
Sound
sessions
represented
significant
departure
from
the
control
customarily
exerted
by
Hill
and
Range
Moman
still
had
to
deal
with
the
publisher
staff
on
site
whose
song
suggestions
he
regarded
as
unacceptable
He
was
on
the
verge
of
quitting
until
Presley
ordered
the
Hill
and
Range
personnel
out
of
the
studio
Although
RCA
executive
Joan
Deary
was
later
full
of
praise
for
the
producer
song
choices
and
the
quality
of
the
recordings
Moman
to
his
fury
received
neither
credit
on
the
records
nor
royalties
for
his
work
Throughout
his
entire
career
Presley
performed
in
only
three
venues
outside
the
United
States
all
of
them
in
Canada
during
brief
tours
there
in
In
he
remarked

country
and
after
that

to
see
some
places
ve
never
seen
before
Rumors
that
he
would
play
overseas
for
the
first
time
were
fueled
in
by
million
dollar
bid
for
an
Australian
tour
Parker
was
uncharacteristically
reluctant
prompting
those
close
to
Presley
to
speculate
about
the
manager
past
and
the
reasons
for
his
evident
unwillingness
to
apply
for
passport
After
Presley
death
it
was
revealed
that
Parker
was
born
Andreas
Cornelis
van
Kuijk
in
the
Netherlands
having
immigrated
illegally
to
the
he
had
reason
to
fear
that
if
he
left
the
country
he
would
not
be
allowed
back
in
again
Parker
ultimately
squelched
any
notions
Presley
had
of
working
abroad
claiming
that
foreign
security
was
poor
and
the
venues
unsuitable
for
star
of
his
magnitude
Parker
arguably
exercised
tightest
control
over
Presley
film
career
Hal
Wallis
said
rather
try
and
close
deal
with
the
devil
than
with
Parker
Fellow
movie
producer
Sam
Katzman
described
him
as
the
biggest
con
artist
in
the
world
In
Robert
Mitchum
asked
Presley
to
costar
with
him
in
Thunder
Road
which
Mitchum
was
producing
and
writing
According
to
George
Klein
one
of
his
oldest
friends
Presley
was
also
offered
starring
roles
in
West
Side
Story
and
Midnight
Cowboy
In
Barbra
Streisand
approached
Presley
to
star
with
her
in
the
remake
of
Star
is
Born
In
each
case
any
ambitions
the
singer
may
have
had
to
play
such
parts
were
thwarted
by
his
manager
negotiating
demands
or
flat
refusals
In
Lacker
description
The
only
thing
that
kept
Elvis
going
after
the
early
years
was
new
challenge
But
Parker
kept
running
everything
into
the
ground
The
prevailing
attitude
may
have
been
summed
up
best
by
the
response
Leiber
and
Stoller
received
when
they
brought
serious
film
project
for
Presley
to
Parker
and
the
Hill
and
Range
owners
for
their
consideration
In

telling
Jean
Aberbach
warned
them
to
never
again
try
to
interfere
with
the
business
or
artistic
workings
of
the
process
known

Elvis

Memphis
Mafia
Main

Memphis
Mafia
In
the
early
the
circle
of
friends
with
whom
Presley
constantly
surrounded
himself
until
his
death
came
to
be
known
as
the
Memphis
Mafia
Surrounded
by
the
ir
parasitic
presence
as
journalist
John
Harris
puts
it
it
was
no
wonder
that
as
he
slid
into
addiction
and
torpor
no
one
raised
the
alarm
to
them
Elvis
was
the
bank
and
it
had
to
remain
open
Tony
Brown
who
played
piano
for
Presley
regularly
in
the
last
two
years
of
the
singer
life
observed
his
rapidly
declining
health
and
the
urgent
need
to
address
it
But
we
all
knew
it
was
hopeless
because
Elvis
was
surrounded
by
that
little
circle
of
people
all
those
so
called
friends
In
the
Memphis
Mafia
defense
Marty
Lacker
has
said
Presley
was
his
own
man
If
we
hadn
been
around
he
would
have
been
dead
lot
earlier
Larry
Geller
became
Presley
hairdresser
in
Unlike
others
in
the
Memphis
Mafia
he
was
interested
in
spiritual
questions
and
recalls
how
from
their
first
conversation
Presley
revealed
his
secret
thoughts
and
anxieties
mean
there
has
to
be
purpose
there
got
to
be
reason
why
was
chosen
to
be
Elvis
Presley
swear
to
God
no
one
knows
how
lonely
get
And
how
empty
really
feel
Thereafter
Geller
supplied
him
with
books
on
religion
and
mysticism
which
the
singer
read
voraciously
Presley
would
be
preoccupied
by
such
matters
for
much
of
his
life
taking
trunkloads
of
books
with
him

Presley
Notes
Although
some
pronounce
his
surname
pr
zli
PREZ
lee
Presley
himself
used
the
Southern
American
English
pronunciation
pr
sli
PRES
lee
as
did
his
family
and
those
who
worked
with
him
The
correct
spelling
of
his
middle
name
has
long
been
matter
of
debate
The
physician
who
delivered
him
wrote
Elvis
Aaron
Presley
in
his
ledger
The
state
issued
birth
certificate
reads
Elvis
Aron
Presley
The
name
was
chosen
after
the
Presleys
friend
and
fellow
congregation
member
Aaron
Kennedy
though
single
spelling
was
probably
intended
by
Presley
parents
in
order
to
parallel
the
middle
name
of
Presley
stillborn
brother
Jesse
Garon
It
reads
Aron
on
most
official
documents
produced
during
his
lifetime
including
his
high
school
diploma
RCA
record
contract
and
marriage
license
and
this
was
generally
taken
to
be
the
proper
spelling
In
Presley
expressed
the
desire
to
his
father
that
the
more
traditional
biblical
rendering
Aaron
be
used
henceforth
especially
on
legal
documents
Five
years
later
the
Jaycees
citation
honoring
him
as
one
of
the
country
Outstanding
Young
Men
used
Aaron
Late
in
his
life
he
sought
to
officially
change
the
spelling
to
Aaron
and
discovered
that
state
records
already
listed
it
that
way
Knowing
his
wishes
for
his
middle
name
Aaron
is
the
spelling
his
father
chose
for
Presley
tombstone
and
it
is
the
spelling
his
estate
has
designated
as
official
In
her
book
Elvis
and
Gladys
Dundy
also
states
that
Presley
great
great
grandmother
Nancy
Burdine
Tackett
was
Jewish
citing
third
cousin
of
Presley
Oscar
Tackett
However
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
Presley
family
shared
this
belief
and
the
syndicated
columnist
and
Jewish
genealogist
Nate
Bloom
has
challenged
the
cousin
account
which
he
calls
tall
tale
Of
the
covered
back
royalties
owed
by
Sun
In
Presley
was
also
credited
as
cowriter
on
several
songs
where
he
had
no
hand
in
the
writing
process
Heartbreak
Hotel
Don
Be
Cruel
all
four
songs
from
his
first
film
including
the
title
track
Love
Me
Tender
Paralyzed
and
All
Shook
Up
Parker
however
failed
to
register
Presley
with
such
musical
licensing
firms
as
ASCAP
and
or
its
rival
BMI
which
eventually
denied
Presley
annuity
from
songwriter
royalties
He
received
credit
on
two
other
songs
to
which
he
did
contribute
he
provided
the
title
for
That

in
Whitburn
follows
actual
Billboard
history
in
considering
the
four
songs
on
the
Don
Be
Cruel
Hound
Dog
and
Don
Beg
of
You
singles
as
distinct
He
tallies
each
side
of
the
former
single
as
number
one
Billboard
sales
chart
had
Don
Be
Cruel
at
number
one
for
five
weeks
then
Hound
Dog
for
six
and
reckons
Beg
of
You
as
top
ten
as
it
reached
number
eight
on
the
old
Top
chart
Billboard
now
considers
both
singles
as
unified
items
ignoring
the
historical
sales
split
of
the
former
and
its
old
Top
chart
entirely
Whitburn
thus
analyzes
the
four
songs
as
yielding
three
number
ones
and
total
of
four
top
tens
Billboard
now
states
that
they
yielded
just
two
number
ones
and
total
of
two
top
tens
voiding
the
separate
chart
appearances
of
Hound
Dog
and
Beg
of
You
The
year
given
is
the
year
the
record
first
reached
number
one
rather
than
its
original
year
of
release
For
instance
in
Elvis
Greatest
compilation
on
the
budget
Arcade
label
was
the
fourth
highest
selling
album
of
the
year
in
the
United
Kingdom
at
the
time
the
main
British
chart
did
not
rank
such
compilations
relegating
them
to
chart
for
midpriced
and
TV
advertised
albums
which
Elvis
Greatest
topped
for
weeks
The
policy
was
altered
in
allowing
the
album
to
hit
number
one
on
the
main
chart
in
following
Presley
death
Before
late
rather
than
unified
pop
and
country
singles
charts
Billboard
had
as
many
as
four
charts
for
each
separately
ranking
records
according
to

jukebox

and
in
the
case
of

Top
Billboard
now
regards
the
sales

as
definitive
for
the
period
Widely
cited
chart
statistician
Joel
Whitburn
accords
historical
releases
the
highest
ranking
they
achieved
among
the
separate

Presley
discographer
Ernst

refers
only
to
the

for
pop
hits
All
of
the
songs
listed

Several

reached

as

the
